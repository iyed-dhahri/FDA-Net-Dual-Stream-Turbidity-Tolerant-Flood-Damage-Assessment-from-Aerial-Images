# FDA-Net: Dual-Stream Turbidity-Tolerant Flood Damage Assessment from Aerial Images

## Overview

In this work, we present our approach that adoptsan ensemble framework which integrates two complementary deep learning modules designed for distinct, yet synergistic, post-flood assessment tasks (see Figure 2). The first module performs building detection by
using a YOLOv8 that is pretrained on Building Instance Segmentation (BIS) dataset of high-quality satellite images (transfer-learning). The second module estimates the spatial extent of flooding through a pixel-wise segmentation using a UNet model trained on the Flood Area Segmentation (FAS) dataset. The resulting framework, named FDA-Net, is applied to aerial flood imagery to generate predictions for both building detection and flooded regions. These generated features are subsequently combined and visualized on considered raw aerial images, yielding a regrouped representation that includes detected buildings alongside a pixel-level flood segmentation map.
