# Building Segmentation in Aerial Imagery using YOLOv8

This repository contains the implementation and evaluation code for the research article: **"[FDA-Net: Dual-Stream Turbidity-Tolerant Flood Damage Assessment from Aerial Images.]"**.

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on the automatic segmentation of building footprints in aerial imagery, addressing the challenges posed by varying camera angles (oblique vs. near-nadir). We utilize fine-tuned variants of the YOLOv8 architecture (Nano, Small, and Medium) to achieve efficient and accurate building detection.

## 🚀 Proposed Approach

The proposed method utilizes a fine-tuned YOLOv8-Seg model to process high-quality imagery. The pipeline handles both **near-nadir** (top-down) and **oblique** (angled) perspectives effectively.

## 📊 Experimental Results

We evaluated three model variants (`n`, `s`, `m`) on the dataset. The quantitative results indicate that the **YOLOv8s-seg** model provides the best balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Quantitative Performance

| Model | Variant | mAP50 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **YOLOv8n-Seg** | Nano | 0.628 |
| **YOLOv8s-Seg** | Small | **0.651** |
| **YOLOv8m-Seg** | Medium | 0.613 |

### Qualitative Results

Below are examples of the segmentation performance on test images with different viewing angles.
