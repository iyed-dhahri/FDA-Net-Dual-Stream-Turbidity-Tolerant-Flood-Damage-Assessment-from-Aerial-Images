## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper **"[Insert Your Paper Title]"**.

Standard aerial segmentation models often fail when buildings are viewed from an angle (**oblique**) rather than directly from above (**nadir**). This project solves that problem by fine-tuning YOLOv8 architecture to recognize building "concepts" regardless of the camera perspective.

### Key Features
* ✅ **Perspective Robustness:** Handles high off-nadir angles.
* ✅ **Lightweight:** Runs on standard hardware (no heavy GPU required for inference).
* ✅ **High Precision:** Optimized for distinct building boundaries.

## 🚀 Proposed Approach

We utilize a modified **YOLOv8-Seg** architecture. The model treats building segmentation as an instance segmentation task, allowing it to separate connected buildings effectively.

## 📊 Performance

We compared three model scales on the BIS dataset. The **Small (s)** variant offers the best trade-off between speed and accuracy.

| Model Variant | Parameters | mAP@50 | Inference Speed |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **YOLOv8n-Seg** (Nano) | 3.2M | 0.628 | ⚡ Very Fast |
| **YOLOv8s-Seg** (Small) | 11.2M | **0.651** | ⚖️ **Balanced** |
| **YOLOv8m-Seg** (Medium) | 25.9M | 0.613 | 🐢 Slower |
